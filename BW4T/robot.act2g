% The goTo action makes the agent move to a place (location) in the BW4T environment.
% As long as the agent has not arrived at the place it is going to, it will be in "traveling" mode and the place has to exist.
define goTo(Location) with
	pre { not(state(traveling)), place(Location) }
	post { true }

% Exercise 2.3a: insert a specification for the goToBlock(Block) action.
% Make sure that the agent is in the same room as the block  and not traveling
define goToBlock(Block) with 
	pre{ block(Block,Color,Room),in(Room),not(state(traveling))}
	post{ true}
% Exercise 2.3b: insert a specification for the pickUp action.
% If the agent is at the block and it doesn't hold another block then it can hold that block and the block will be removed after the agent is holding it
define pickUp(Block) with 
	pre {atBlock(Block),not(holding(_)),block(Block,Color,Room))}
	post {holding(Block),not(block(Block,Color,Room))}
% Exercise 2.3c: insert a specification for the putDown action.
% if the agent is holding an block it will drop it
define putDown with
 	pre{ holding(Block) }
 	post{not(holding(Block))}
